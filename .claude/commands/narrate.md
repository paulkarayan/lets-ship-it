Read the file at $ARGUMENTS. This is a raw draft — shorthand notes, terminal output, stream-of-consciousness.

Turn it into a blog post. Write the output to `chapters/raw/narrated/<filename>` (same filename, just in the `narrated/` subdirectory). Create the directory if it doesn't exist.

## Voice rules

- Write like a person talking to a friend who codes. Not a conference talk. Not a Medium post.
- Short sentences. Leave gaps. Let the reader think.
- No filler. Cut "let's dive in", "in this post we'll explore", "as you can see". Cut all of it.
- No adverbs. No "simply", "just", "easily", "actually", "basically".
- No AI tells: "robust", "streamline", "leverage", "comprehensive", "crucial", "it's worth noting".
- Don't explain things the reader can figure out. Trust them.
- Keep the author's opinions and asides — they're the point.
- Terminal output and code blocks: keep them, clean them up if needed, but don't narrate what they show line by line.
- If the draft has a "try this yourself" or interactive prompt, keep that energy. Don't flatten it into exposition.
- It's ok to end a section abruptly. Not everything needs a transition.
- Prefer incomplete over polished. A rough edge is better than a smooth nothing.
